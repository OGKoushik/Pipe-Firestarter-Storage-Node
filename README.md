#   **Introductionüìî**

‚ö°Ô∏èPipe Firestarter is a decentralized storage and delivery network, like a blockchain-powered alternative to Google Drive + Cloudflare. Instead of relying on one company, it spreads files across independent nodes, making data faster, safer, and censorship-resistant.

Built on Solana, it already stores 1 petabyte of Solana‚Äôs blockchain history, cutting validator sync times by ~30%. Users can upload files or folders, encrypt them for privacy, and deliver content worldwide with low latency.

Payments are made in $PIPE tokens (Devnet) (1 PIPE ‚âà 1 GB). When tokens are burned for storage, they are re-minted and rewarded to node operators‚Äîso the community runs the infrastructure, not corporations.

In short: Firestarter gives developers and users a full-stack decentralized alternative for storage, CDN, and edge compute at a fraction of the cost.
